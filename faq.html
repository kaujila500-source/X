<section class="section container">
<div class="card"><h3>How much does a solar panel system cost?</h3><p>The cost varies depending on your energy needs, location, and available incentives. We provide a free, no-obligation quote to give you a personalized estimate.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>How much money will I save on my electricity bill?</h3><p>Savings depend on your system size, energy consumption, and local utility rates. Many homeowners reduce their bills significantly, and some even eliminate them entirely.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>What happens on cloudy days or at night?</h3><p>Your system will produce less power on cloudy days, but it still generates electricity. At night, or when your usage exceeds your production, you will draw power from the utility grid as usual.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>Do I need a battery?</h3><p>A battery is not required, but it allows you to store excess solar energy for use at night or during a power outage, providing energy independence. We can help you decide if a battery is right for you.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>How long do solar panels last?</h3><p>Our high-quality solar panels come with a 25-year performance warranty and are designed to last for decades with minimal maintenance.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>Will solar panels increase my property value?</h3><p>Yes! Studies have shown that homes with solar panel systems sell for more than comparable homes without them. It's an investment that pays off both monthly and upon resale.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>What is the installation process like?</h3><p>Our team handles everything from design and permitting to installation and inspection. A typical residential installation takes just 1-3 days on-site.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>What incentives are available?</h3><p>There are federal tax credits, and many states and local utilities offer additional rebates or incentives. We will help you identify and apply for all the programs you qualify for.</p></div>
<div class="card"><h3>How do I get started?</h3><p>Simply contact us through our website or give us a call! We'll start with a free consultation to assess your needs and show you how much you can save by going solar.</p></div>
